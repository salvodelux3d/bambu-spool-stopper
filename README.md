# Bambu Spool Stopper

Simple functional accessory to prevent filament spools from rolling inside drawers.

Designed for Bambu Lab spools but compatible with most standard 1kg filament spools.

**Version:** 1.1  
**Status:** Stable – MakerWorld release  
**Workflow:** SketchUp → nanoCAD → OpenSCAD → Bambu Studio → MakerWorld

---

## Features
- Compact functional design

## For MakerWorld users
If you are here to **print the model**:

✅ Use the **STL files** in the `/export` folder  
✅ Files are tested and ready to print  
❌ No CAD software required

---

## Project Workflow
This project follows a **progressive design workflow**:

1. **SketchUp** – fast concept and shape definition  
2. **nanoCAD** – dimensional checks and technical refinements  
3. **OpenSCAD** – parametric and reproducible model  
4. **Bambu Studio** – slicing and print tests  
5. **MakerWorld** – final publication

The final reference for printing is always the STL file.

---

## Files Structure
/export → Final STL / STEP files (official print source)
/openscad → Parametric OpenSCAD source
/sketchup → Initial concept and drafts
/nanocad → Technical drawings and 2D profiles
/images → Renders and print photos

---

## Customization
The parametric version is available in OpenSCAD.

Advanced users can:
- adjust dimensions
- change tolerances
- create variants

If you modify the source files, always export a new STL and test the print.
